The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories offer a standardized framework for countries to systematically measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions and removals across various sectors. Aimed at ensuring consistency, comparability, and transparency, these guidelines support international climate commitments. 

The 2019 Refinement updates this framework with the latest scientific and technical advancements, enhancing methodologies, emission factors, and guidance for emerging issues, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of national GHG inventories essential for effective climate change mitigation and policy-making.
